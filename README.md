## About Me
In this era, you can't go a day without hearing, or using AI and Machine learning in one way or the other. Kubam Ivo is a cameroonian by birth. He was privileged to have been exposed to this exciting and ever evolving field of AI and ML. Currently He is enrolled in Universite libre de bruxelles as a specialized master student in Data Science, Big Data. Before that, He had acquired knowledge in this field via certifications such Microsoft Data Scientist Associate, SAS Machine learning specialist and took up related courses in his two previous masters' programs. He has worked on some machine learning personal projects such the Titanic Dataset and House price dataset. He says learning never stops, so he wishes to collaborate with anyone or team doing exciting projects related to AI and ML. Also he is willing to share knowledge or provide help when needed. If Ivo is not having his hands getting dirty with AI and ML, he is having fun playing soccer, socializing, site seeing and swimming.
