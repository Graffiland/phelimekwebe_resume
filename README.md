What an era where you can't go a day without hearing AI and Machine learning. I am Kubam Ivo, a cameroonian by birth. Privileged to have been exposed to to this exciting and ever evolving field of AI and ML. Currently enrolled in Universite libre de bruxelles as a specialized master student in Data Science, Big Data. Before that I have acquired knowledge in this field via certifications such Microsoft Data Scientist Associate, SAS Machine learning specialist and took up related courses in my previous master program. I have worked on some personal projects such the Titanic Dataset and House price dataset. Learning never stops, so i wish to collaborate with anyone or team doing exciting projects related to AI and ML. Also i am willing to share knowledge or provide help when needed. 
If I'm not having fun doing AI and ML, I'm having fun playing soccer, partying out with friends, site seeing and swimming.
